        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
            From the tender age of eight, I discovered my passion for art in an unexpected moment of childhood inspiration. It was a quiet afternoon spent sketching my grandmother in our living room—a memory vivid in my mind, not just for the act of drawing, but for the surprise I felt upon returning from the kitchen to find my artwork amusingly altered by her. This playful interaction, though simple, sparked a lifelong love for artistic expression within me.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Growing up in a family rich with storytellers, I was surrounded by vivid tales shared by my parents about their lives and experiences. These stories, woven with threads of heritage and personal journeys, became the foundation of my creativity. They inspired me to translate spoken narratives into visual form, capturing emotions and history through strokes of color and texture.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            This passion for storytelling through art led me to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Fine Arts. During my studies, I refined my technical skills and explored the diverse forms and expressions of art history. It was here that I discovered the power of art to communicate across cultures and time, and this realization deepened my commitment to my craft.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Currently, I am furthering my education by pursuing a Master’s degree, delving into new dimensions of artistic exploration and personal expression. This journey has allowed me to experiment with innovative techniques and to push the boundaries of how stories can be told visually.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            My work is a reflection of my journey—infused with the memories and stories that have shaped me. As an artist, I strive to convey not just images but emotions and narratives, inviting viewers to step into a world seen through my eyes and perhaps find a piece of their own story reflected back.

                <h2>Inspiration</h2>
                <p>Throughout my career, my work has been deeply inspired by various influences, from the works of William Turner to the rich stories of my heritage. While studying in China, my art reflects a journey of cultural discovery, with a particular focus on Seychelles’ history, its traditions, and the stories of my family. My approach to painting is rooted in storytelling, capturing the essence of these narratives through the medium of oil painting.</p>
